WebLurker
=========

********************************************
A simple, flexible and powerful web scraper
********************************************
WebLurker is a library written entirely in Python 3. 
It is being developed with three principles in mind:
- Power
- Flexibility
- Easy to use

And of course, learning.

************
Installation
************

I'm in the process of making it work with *pip*, but you can put the library in the same workspace you're working on and it *should* work.

Requirements
============

It uses the *requests* library.
You can install it with *pip install requests* (remember to use Python's 3 pip)

*************
Documentation
*************
I have to gather all the spare docs I have, but I'll post them here asap.
Until then, I recommend to look up the code. I think the code is pretty clear and understandable, but if you think it isn't please let me know, this project is mainly for learning.

*WebLurker* is being developed by `JavierLuna <javierlunamolina@gmail.com>`_ and supervised by `blazaid <https://github.com/blazaid>`_.




Warning
=======
I didn't test it with any lower version than Python 3 and I will not support any other version than the official.

I'm pretty new to Python, and I love web scraping, so I decided to develop this project with learning as my main focus, so If you have any sujestions, ideas... please let me now.

Also, I'm spanish, so sorry about my english!
